## About

This repository contains two types of GDC implementation using RISC-V Assembly using [RARS - RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars) simulator, which was used in an Computer Architecture class taken in my Master's Degree.

## Run

You need to have Java Runtime installed on your machine, then download the JAR fille of [RARS - RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars), copy and paste each .asm file and click on build and run, or you can also import each .asm file.
